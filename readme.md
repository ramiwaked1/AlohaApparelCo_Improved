# Personal Learnings
#### Project 1
>I have learned many things with this first project. The above listed technologies are just one aspect. Creating a website can be quite complex. Building out the design on paper (or other medium) is very helpful in planning out the code required to build a site. I also learned specificity in regards to CSS is truly an art and requires further practice. Understanding and applying my knowledge of HTML and CSS is still a work in progress, and I hope to improve over time.

#### Project 2
>The second part of this project taught me:

* It is very important to build the foundation of a site properly before attempting to improve or make further changes to an existing site as it could be difficult to make improvements at a later time.

* JavaScript cannot be learned in a few days and I need to make more time to practice to improve my skills.

* Through my research and discussions with my peers, I learned that there can be more than one way to approach an issue.  

* The value of plugins and tools can be very helpful in identifying underlying issues in code or assist in making a website consistent across many browsers, such as an autoprefixer.
