# Project 1: Aloha Apparel Co.

My project was to create a homepage for a client at Aloha Apparel Co. using HTML and CSS.

I also added interactivity to this website with JS, and implemented a mobile-first, responsive layout with flexbox (optimized for the three required screen sizes). This website's homepage is responsive for mobiles, tablets and desktops.
