# Project 1: Aloha Apparel Co.
![Alt text](http://i.imgur.com/CVN1WWR.png "Aloha")

My project was to create a homepage for a client at Aloha Apparel Co. using HTML and CSS.

I also added interactivity to this website with JS, and implemented a mobile-first, responsive layout with flexbox (optimized for the three required screen sizes). This website's homepage is responsive for mobiles, tablets and desktops.

Aloha is a school project for REDAcademy. It is my very first web development project.</p>
<p>Aloha is an apparel shopping website.
